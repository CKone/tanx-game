# Urban Map Follow-Up Notes

- **Automated coverage**: add unit tests for building placement to ensure flattened platforms, collapse sequencing, and rubble height decay behave consistently.
- **Balance tuning**: revisit floor and rubble HP values after playtesting; keep match length brisk while preserving the spectacle of collapses.
- **Superpowers**: expand tests around bomber/squad strikes hitting buildings and rubble so AoE damage stays in sync with terrain artillery.
- **Performance**: profile large-map scenarios with many rubble segments to confirm rendering and collision checks stay responsive.
- **Audio/UX**: see `docs/audio_ux_testing.md` for the detailed plan covering mixer integration, volume controls, and QA checklist.
